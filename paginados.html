        <h3><center><p>It's Been a Long, Long Time <br>
            Never thought that you would be<br>
            Standing here so close to me<br>
            There is so much I feel that I should say<br>
            But words can wait until some other day<br><br>
            
            Kiss me once<br>
            Then, kiss me twice<br>
            Then, kiss me once again<br>
            It's been a long, long time<br><br>
            
            Haven't felt like this, my dear<br>
            Since can't remember when<br>
            It's been a long, long time<br><br>
            
            You'll never know<br>
            How many dreams I dream about you<br>
            Or just how empty they all seem without you<br><br>s
            
            So, kiss me once<br>
            Then, kiss me twice<br>
            Then, kiss me once again<br>
            It's been a long, long time<br>
